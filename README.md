# ♟️ Python Chess Game

A basic two-player chess game built in Python. This was one of my early projects created to explore game development logic and GUI handling using `pygame`.

> ⚠️ Note: This project currently doesn't include game-end detection (like check, checkmate, or stalemate). It supports piece movement and two-player interaction on the same machine.

## 🎯 Features

- Drag-and-drop piece movement
- Legal movement logic for all chess pieces
- Turn-based two-player system
- Board rendered with `pygame`

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented

- Check / Checkmate detection
- Move validation (e.g., king can't move into check)
- Win / Draw screen
- AI opponent or online multiplayer

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) – for rendering and user interaction

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 and pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
## 🧠 Learning Focus
This project helped me understand:

- Object-oriented game logic

- Handling 2D grids and mapping user inputs

- Rendering UI using pygame

- Basics of turn-based game systems

🙌 Contributing
This project is open for learning, experimentation, or extension. Feel free to fork it and build your own version – maybe even add checkmate logic or an AI bot!
